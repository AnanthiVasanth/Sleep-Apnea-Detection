Sleep Apnea Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model
The ECG signal is pre-processed and analyzed by the deep learning model to recognize sleep apnea. Among deep learning techniques, convolutional network (MobileNetV1) and hybrid convolutional-recurrent networks: MobileNetV1-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and MobileNetV1-GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) are implemented. It is found that the hybrid deep model MobileNetV1-GRU achieved the best detection results with an accuracy of 90.07%.
